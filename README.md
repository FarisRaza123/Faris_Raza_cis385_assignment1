Assignment 1

My project is an "All about me" type of webpage that includes photos and different things that I enjoy. It meets all the requirements of the assignment while also adding my own personal code. 

In the home page file you will find an introduciton and a combination of different CSS properties and selectors. There are ID and .class selectors scattered all across the website but you will primarily find them in the home page.

In the Lists page you will find a couple of lists of my favorite things that have accompanying pictures. 

In the Table page there is a table of the current NFL passing leaders and their current touchdowns.

In the Image page there is a couple of pictures with captions underneath them.
